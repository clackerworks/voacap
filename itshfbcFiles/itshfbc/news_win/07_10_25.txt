25 Oct  2007   1. This change only affects REC533.
                  REC533 would fail with a division by zero at the North
                  pole when the transmitter was far enough away to require
                  the long path model (FTZ) to be run. 
                  This would occur if you used the Area Coverage over the
                  whole world and the transmitter was below the equator.
                  This has been fixed.
