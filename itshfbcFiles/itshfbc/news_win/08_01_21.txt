21 Jan  2008   1. It appears that while running ICEAREA for Lat/Lon projection
                  in the western hemisphere (longitude < 0) the noise calculation
                  could be wrong. This has been fixed.
                  It does not appear that this was a problem with VOAAREA or REC533.
