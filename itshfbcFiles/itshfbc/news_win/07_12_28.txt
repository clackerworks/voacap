28 Dec  2007    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

28 Dec  2007   1. A transparent change was made to VOACAP.
                  Someone pointed out that the goemagnetic north pole moves
                  and he wants to see what affect moving the pole has.
                  The geomagnetic north pole coordinates (glat, glon) were
                  fixed in subroutine geom at (78.50N, 69.00W).
                  These coordinates are now located in the file:
                     ..\database\north_pole.txt
                  If this file does not exist, the location (78.5,-69.0) is used.
                  For a user to change this, he should copy the file:
                     ..\database\north_pole.txt
                  to:
                     ..\run\north_pole.txt
                  and then change the first record of this file.
                  The file in the "run" directory will override the file in the
                  "database" directory.
                  Remember that it is your responsibility to remember which
                  output file corresponds to what values of (glat, glon).
                  There is currently no information in the output file indicating
                  the (glat, glon) values.
                  It is recommended that no one change this location without
                  knowing what they are doing.

                  Documentation about this change is found in the file:
                    ..\database\north_pole.txt

                  This change has not been made to ICEPAC or REC533.
