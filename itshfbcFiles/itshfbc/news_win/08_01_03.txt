03 Jan  2008    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

03 Jan  2008   1. It has been discovered that if the install directory 
                  is more than about 27 characters in length, the software
                  would fail. An example of this would be installing the
                  software in the directory:
                     e:\swl\propaga\hfwin32\itshfbc
                  This has been increased, to at least 46 characters.
                  Please do not get carried away with the length of your
                  directory names. This affects almost all of the executables.
